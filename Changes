+ Decided to release a 'production' version. It works, it works
  well, it just lacks some documentation. This way, people will 
	find it. That's good.

+ Fixed a bug that'd allow trailing data after the last }

1.8_7 Wed 17 March 2004, 15:00pm GBT

+ Actually fixed ansi/charmap problem actually for real :-/

1.8_6 Sun 14 March 2004, 22:00pm GBT

+ 'ansi' and 'char_map' files put into modules, to make
  packing the module into an executable easier, and to
  make some really nasty code redundant
+ RTF::TEXT::Converter does The Right Thing with entities
  and blank lines, even on non \ansi files...
+ Little files now get converted properly
- \ulnone treated like \ul0 in RTF::Control

1.8_5 Sat 24 January 2004, 10:45pm GBT

+ Documentation is almost done
+ RTF::Parser is fully tested
+ Final beta release?
